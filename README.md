# Marketing-resources-for-developers

A handpicked and time proven marketing and growth articles and tools to grow your product🚀


Often creat ideas needs some extra nudge to lift off. 
After building a productivity tool for mobile app developers and early stage companies, we understood that our struggles with marketing and growth were not unique. We listed down some resources that helped us to find product marketing fit, grow the first user base, understand our target group and scale without a massive budget or human resources. 

Over the past 4 years our marketing team at [Codemagic CI/CD](https://codemagic.io/start/) by Nevercode:
- launched Codemagic in cooperation with Google on Flutter Live event and Testmagic on Mobile World Congress Barcelona Google stage.
- Rebranded successfully Nevercode and Codmeagic brand into tool that develpers love according to [Google survey](https://medium.com/flutter/improving-flutter-with-your-opinion-q4-2019-survey-results-ba0e6721bf23).
- Developed and executed a comprehensive content strategy based on extensive SEO analytics. Growing a highly technical blog to 64K blog visitors/ month in 1.5 years.

We listed down articles, videos, spreadsheets, podcasts that have helped us closer where we are today! Furthermore, we are sharing marketing stack we use to keep track on our activities and success! Note that the list of the marketing activities goes in order that it made sense for us to start as an early stage company.
